HTML | CSS | JavaScript | Node.js | JSON | API


Currently Building
Just began construction of a Weather App Project using the api from weatherapi.com.

https://api.weatherapi.com/v1/current.json?q=aiken&key=...

npm i express.js

My main focus at this time was gaining a better understanding of how I could view the different aspects of JSON objects inside of the terminal. I also learned of a free resouce to view the JSON. The name of the resource is Seven JSON Viewer. It works for Microsoft Edge if you prefer it for that browser.

I now have a better understanding of how to look through that form of data that I didn't previously quite understand, especially once I was able to get past trying to learn how to implement the api key appropriately. (Thank you documentation). 

Also reinforced that console.log can not look up specific features from a API JSON unless they have been declared as a variable in your current JS file.

Additionally, in this project we are rendering the page using JavaScript to create and insert the HTML markup into the index.html
